Our custodian banks will generally reject cash deposits in the wrong currency. In order to speed up the process, you can proceed as follows:

* Contact your bank and ask them to recall the wire transfer.
* Ask your sending bank for a proof of deposit, a copy of the deposit slip, bank statement or the receipt of deposit which should include your account name and account number, and send it to MEXEM Client Services via Message Center in Client Portal explaining the situation and asking to facilitate the wire transfer rejection.


**Please Note**

* [Although you can fund your account in multiple currencies](https://www.interactivebrokers.ie/lib/cstools/faq/#/content/52490649), wire routing instructions vary by currency. It is critical to provide your bank with proper instructions, otherwise the transfer can be rejected or converted to another currency. Since error-handling procedures are subject to bank discretion and outside our control, we are unable to assume responsibility for improperly applied instructions.

Third party deposits also include check deposits made payable to the MEXEM account holder and endorsed over to MEXEM.


As third-party transfers have historically been viewed by the financial services industry and its regulators as being highly susceptible to acts of fraud and money laundering, they are strongly discouraged and generally rejected by MEXEM.


In the case of deposits made by check, MEXEM will not accept any checks which require endorsement to MEXEM and will only accept check deposits having MEXEM as the direct payee where the party who writes the check either:

* Has the same last name as the individual account holder \(e.g.; spouse or, child\); or
* In the case of organization/institution accounts, maintains an affiliation with the account \(e.g.; owners\).


MEXEM reserves the right to reject any third-party deposit received as an electronic transfer \(Wire, ACH or EFT\). MEXEM will generally accept funds from spouses and partners. MEXEM will generally not accept deposits for other persons or companies identified through the firm's reviews.


In accordance with its regulatory obligations, MEXEM may conduct additional due diligence on client deposits, particularly deposits from anyone other than the account holder. Please note that this is a general guidance and local requirements may apply for acceptance of third party deposits. 


**IMPORTANT NOTICE**

A wire deposit's time to arrive is from immediate to four business days, depending on the volume of wires processed \(i.e.  via Federal Reserve, SWIFT or other processing agency\). Non-U.S. banks are generally at the longer end of the range. Credit to the account is immediate upon arrival. MEXEM applies a one-day holding period to GBP Faster Payments.


MEXEM retrieves incoming wires to its bank accounts every 15 minutes during business hours and, if there is match to a deposit notification, our system automatically posts the funds to the client's account.


MEXEM posting delays to client accounts may occur because:

* The client didn't [submit a deposit notification](https://www.interactivebrokers.ie/lib/cstools/faq/#/content/27280950) or the [wrong amount was entered on the deposit notification](https://www.interactivebrokers.ie/lib/cstools/faq/#/content/32647391)
* The sending bank improperly formatted the wire \(and therefore client identifiers do not appear on MEXEM's bank reports\)
* The sending bank misspelled the client's name or incorrectly input other client identifiers so an automatic match to the deposit notification cannot occur
* MEXEM's bank didn't display the client identifiers on its bank reporting system \(we then ask our bank for additional details on the incoming wire\)


If you have created a deposit notification and the funds are still missing, please provide details of the deposit and Proof of Deposit by sending us a message through the Message Center in [Client Portal](https://www.interactivebrokers.ie/sso/resolver?action=NEW_TICKET) for MEXEM to investigate.


If MEXEM can't identify the client, then MEXEM will return the funds to the sending bank.

https://www.ibkr.com/faq?id=391776653,Funding & Asset Transfers,Cash Deposits,Deposit Currencies,How do I deposit GBP to Interactive Brokers?,"**What type of transfer can I use to fund my account with GBP?**


MEXEM has a bank account located at a UK bank which is eligible to receive GBP via UK transfer methods such as BACS, CHAPS, FASTER Payment as well as international bank transfer \(SWIFT\) in case your bank is located outside of the UK.


**What information does my bank need to transfer funds?**


We will provide you the GBP bank routing information upon [completing the deposit notification](https://www.interactivebrokers.ie/lib/cstools/faq/#/content/27280950) in Client Portal.


MEXEM will provide you both, the sort code and account number of our bank account for UK local transfer method\`s \(BACS, CHAPS, Faster Payment\), as well as our IBAN and SWIFT for international bank transfer if your bank is located outside of the UK or in case they do not offer alternative transfer method\`s.


**How long does it usually take for my funds to arrive?**

|  Payment Type   |  Timing   |  Approximate Cost\*   |
|  CHAPS   |  Can be instant, or up to 1 working day   |  £25   |
|  Faster Payment   |  Usually within seconds, but can take up to 2 hoursâï¿½¶   |  £0 to ~ £0.50   |
|  BACS   |  Usually 2 working days   |  £0 to ~ £0.50   |
|  SWIFT   |  Depends on the banks involved - SWIFT payments take 1 - 4 days on average, longer for some destinations   |  £25+   |

\*Please consult with the sending institution about the costs to process your payment as this may vary by financial institution. MEXEM does not charge fees for the deposit of funds.


**Note**

* MEXEM credits funds in real time upon receipt under normal circumstances. 
* MEXEM does not have influence on the speed of transfer. You may consult with the sending institution regarding their processing times and cut off times.
* Payments that are subject to additional review may take longer to credit.

https://www.ibkr.com/faq?id=442906370,Funding & Asset Transfers,Cash Deposits,Deposit Currencies,How do I deposit HKD to Interactive Brokers?,"Different deposit methods may be available to you depending on the country in which your bank account is held and the MEXEM entity your trading account was opened under. 


**Deposit Methods Only Available to Clients of MEXEM Hong Kong Ltd \(IBHK\)**


**Faster Payment System \(FPS\)**


The Faster Payment System is a payment infrastructure introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority \(HKMA\) and operated by Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited \(HKICL\) to enable instant payments in HK.


Fund transfers from your Hong Kong \(HK\) bank account are instructed by entering our FPS ID number, or by scanning a QR code, provided in our transfer instructions. While the FPS ID can be used for all transfer amounts, QR codes are only provided for small-value payments \(i.e. 10,000 HKD or below\).  Funds are generally received and credited within hours.


**Electronic Direct Debit Authorization \(****eDDA****\)**


Using the Faster Payment System, eDDA offers a quick and convenient way to draw funds from your HK bank account to credit your IBHK account. 


To setup your HK bank account for eDDA deposits, you simply need to select the transfer currency, provide your bank account number, and confirm your authorization for MEXEM to establish an eDDA on your behalf.  Once the initial eDDA setup request has been confirmed by your bank, you can top up your IBHK account at any time by simply confirming the desired transfer amount in the **_Make a Deposit_** section of Client Portal.  Funds are generally received and credited within minutes.


**HKD Check**


IBHK can accept personal checks either mailed or dropped off in person to one of our Hong Kong offices, so long as the check meets the following conditions:

* It is denominated in Hong Kong Dollars,
* It has a value of at least HKD 10,000.00,
* It is not postdated or from a third-party bank account,
* It is signed and dated by the account holder,
* The back includes your IBHK account number \(i.e. U\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\) and account name


If the check is being dropped off, please ensure you have your HK ID / Passport with you.  If a third party is dropping off the check for you, they will need to have a letter, signed by you, authorizing them to do so on your behalf.


For mailed in checks, if you are sending the check to remove a funding restriction on your account, ensure the check is posted in the same letter as all supporting forms and a copy of your HK ID / Passport.


Checks received by MEXEM before 12pm \(non\) are generally credited to your account within two business days. Funds will only be available in your account after the check is cleared by your bank. 


**Deposit Methods Available to all MEXEM Clients**


**Domestic Bank Transfer**


Banks in HK offer interbank payments in HKD. To make a local HKD transfer you will need to provide your HK bank, via online banking/branch, with the account details generated for you when you confirm your intended deposit details in the **_Make a Deposit_** section of Client Portal using the **_Bank Wire_** Deposit Method.  This includes the bank account name, bank code, branch code and bank account number. Depending on the times it takes for your bank to process the transfer funds are usually received and credited within hours.


**International Bank Transfer \(SWIFT/ WIRE\)**


The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication \(SWIFT\), is a network that permits banks to communicate financial information securely around the globe.  Most banks offer international money transfers using the SWIFT network.  When a payment is instructed, a series of banks will work together to make sure your money arrives at the instructed destination account.


A transfer of HKD from a financial institution outside of Hong Kong is known as cross-border payment. Your bank may use an intermediary or correspondent bank to transfer the funds to our bank.


Cross-border payments can take some time to complete as they are processed via the correspondent banking network and typically pass between several different banks along the way.  After being initiated, a wire transfer is sent by the debtor agent to an intermediary bank, which transfers the funds to the creditor agent. Once these steps are complete, the recipient will receive their funds.


There are numerous reasons why a cross-border payment may be delayed or held up. Firstly, not all banks can process transfers outside of the operating hours of local settlement systems. Delays can also arise if compliance checks need to be carried out, especially when a payment passes through different countries and jurisdictions.  While newer payment systems allow almost instant transfers, making a payment to another country can be much more complex and time-consuming.


To make an international HKD transfer you will need to provide your bank with the account details generated for you when you confirm your intended deposit details in the **_Make a Deposit_** section of Client Portal using the **_Bank Wire_** Deposit Method.  This includes the bank account name, bank code, branch code, bank account number, SWIFT code, account address and payment reference.


**Difference Between Domestic and International Bank Transfer**


Banks make a **domestic transfer** to send funds to financial institutions residing in the same country or financial zone. When sending funds to financial institutions in a foreign country or financial zone, banks have to make an **international bank transfer**. The differences between these two bank transfers affect the number of fees banks charge and the duration it takes to complete the transfer.

MEXEM, as the originator of the transfer request, imposes this hold as it is obligated to return the funds to your bank, without recourse, should your bank later determine the transfer request to be unauthorized or in error. While your bank generally has the right to validate and request a return of funds well beyond MEXEM's hold period, past experience has proven a 4 business day hold sufficient in most instances.


**Note**

* ACH deposits are eligible for credit interest from the date the deposit arrives and through the hold period. 
* All deposits made by ACH are subject to a standard 4 business days credit hold. Though funds may be released earlier at MEXEM's sole discretion **at the time of acceptance** \(depending on tenure, deposit history and account balance\), MEXEM does not provide any guarantees of the accelerated provision on all ACH deposits.  **Due to the programming configuration of our ACH system, the 4 business day hold cannot be overridden once applied.**  
* Brokers receiving ACH funds transfer to portfolio margin accounts will not have the funds credited to the account until the funds are settled. If you seek immediate use of funds in your portfolio margin account, you may wish to consider a wire transfer.
* Clients who require immediate use of deposited funds are encouraged to use bank or broker wire transfers which are irrevocable and are therefore credited to your account and available for trading purposes immediately upon arrival. MEXEM does not charge for incoming wires for any currency with the exception of the [Mexican Peso](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=14718).

If your U.S. broker is a participant, you may request a transfer of that account to MEXEM via a process referred to as ACATS \(Automated Customer Account Transfer Service\). This process permits for the electronic transfer of securities and cash through the depository with completion of the process taking anywhere between 3 to 8 business days.


**Step 1: Go to Transfer & Pay followed by Position Transfers, select Incoming and choose United States as the region for the delivering broker. Then select ACATS under Select a Transfer Method.**


**Step 2: Supply Delivering Broker Information \(e.g. the firm you are transferring assets from\)**


If you would like to use previously saved broker information, select Yes and select the information you would like to use.


If you are supplying new broker information, select No and:

* Select your delivering broker name and DTC participant \# from the drop-down list \(please contact your U.S. broker to confirm this detail\);
* Provide your account number at the delivering broker;
* Confirm your account title. This title at MEXEM and the delivering broker must be identical;
* Identify the type of account you have at the delivering broker \(note that this must match your MEXEM account type for the transfer to complete\);
* Enter your Tax Identification Number if a U.S. taxpayer and that information is not already on record with MEXEM. If you are a non-U.S. person, check with your transferring broker to verify whether they have a U.S. Tax Identification Number on record for your account and, if so, enter it here;
* If you intend to transfer additional accounts from this broker in the future, you may save the information. Otherwise, select No.


**Step 3: Provide Transaction Information**


You will be asked if you are transferring all assets.


If Yes, follow the on screen prompts and click continue.


If No \(e.g. a partial transfer\), click the Add Asset button to add each position:

* Select your asset type.
* Select Search by: Symbol, ISIN or CUSIP.
* Provide Additional Information for the asset.
* Click ""Search"".
* Select your Asset from the list and provide information on Quantity, Quantity Type and any other requested information.
* Click ""Add"".
* Click ""Continue"" and provide your electronic signature to initiate the process.


**Please Note**

* If transferring all assets and your account contains mutual funds not offered by MEXEM, you may request that those funds be removed from the transfer request and remain with your current broker. This will minimize the possibility of your transfer request rejecting
* You may not be able to withdraw your transferred assets for up to 30 days after receipt from your third-party broker.
* Futures and Cryptocurrency are not transferable.


You may [monitor the status of your transfer request](https://www.interactivebrokers.ie/sso/resolver?action=VIEW_TRANS_HISTORY) through the Transfer & Pay and Transaction History menu options in Client Portal.

Prior to using this method you will need to create a standing instruction through Client Portal which authorizes MEXEM and your bank to electronically transfer funds between the two accounts.


You will be asked to verify your bank in one of two ways:

* Enter your banking information: You will be asked to enter your bank account number and routing number for instant verification. If we cannot verify the account is in your name, we will issue test transactions in the form of small debit and credit amounts to your bank account.
    * Note: This request does not actually move your funds.
* Log in at your bank: You will be asked to select your bank and enter your username and password to verify your credentials immediately.
    * Note: Verification by logging in at your bank uses a third-party service.


Once established, this transfer method can be used for future deposit and withdrawal requests.

* The process to connect your bank account to be used for ACH deposits/withdrawals can be initiated from your MEXEM account or at your bank [as described in the MEXEM Knowledge Base](http://MEXEM.info/article/567).

MEXEM highly encourages our clients to log in to **[Client Portal](https://www.interactivebrokers.ie/sso/resolver?action=ACCT_MGMT_MAIN)** and provide a notification prior to initiating each transfer of funds from their bank or broker.


The purpose of this deposit notification is as follows:

* MEXEM accepts deposits in multiple currencies and the instructions you'll need to provide your bank to transfer funds to MEXEM can vary by currency. Those instructions are provided through the online deposit notification process and are made available on a printable PDF form. Clients using the incorrect routing instructions risk having their bank convert their deposit into a different currency than intended, often at an unfavorable exchange rate;
* Oftentimes banks remit funds without all of the details necessary to uniquely identify the recipient of the funds and the deposit notification assists with the matching and crediting of the deposit to your account in the fastest manner;
* Finally, the notification permits us to provide the status of your funding request within Client Portal from the point of initiation to arrival along with any hold period.


Valuable information such as the beneficiary address can be found on your deposit notification.

https://www.ibkr.com/faq?id=59325822,Funding & Asset Transfers,Cash Withdrawals,,What is a correspondent bank?,"A correspondent bank is a bank that provides services on behalf of another financial institution. Correspondent banks are most likely to be used by domestic banks to service transactions that either originate or are completed in foreign countries, acting as a domestic bank's agent abroad.


For example: in case you transfer USD to a bank account in Singapore, the correspondent bank is the bank through which your bank in Singapore receives foreign currencies. Your bank in Singapore will have a correspondent bank in the US through which they receive USD. When you place a withdrawal request for USD, the funds will first be sent from our US bank account to the correspondent bank of your bank in the US and they will then send the funds to your bank in Singapore.


Generally speaking, the reasons domestic banks employ correspondent banks include the limited access to foreign financial markets and the inability to service client accounts without opening branches abroad.


Correspondent banking is an essential component of the global payment system, especially for cross-border transactions. Through correspondent banking relationships, banks can access financial services in different jurisdictions and provide cross-border payment services to their customers, supporting international trade and financial inclusion.

**Deposit Methods Only Available to Clients of MEXEM Hong Kong Ltd \(IBHK\)**


**Instant Local Transfer via FPS**


The Faster Payment System is a payment infrastructure introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority \(HKMA\) and operated by Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited \(HKICL\) to enable instant payments in HK.


Fund transfers from your Hong Kong \(HK\) bank account are instructed by entering our FPS ID number, or by scanning a QR code, provided in our transfer instructions. While the FPS ID can be used for all transfer amounts, QR codes are only provided for small-value payments \(i.e. 10,000 HKD equivalent or below\).  Funds are generally received and credited within hours.


**Electronic Direct Debit Authorization \(****eDDA****\)**


Using the Faster Payment System, eDDA offers a quick and convenient way to draw funds from your HK bank account to credit your IBHK account. 


To setup your HK bank account for eDDA deposits, you simply need to select the transfer currency, provide your bank account number, and confirm your authorization for MEXEM to establish an eDDA on your behalf.  Once the initial eDDA setup request has been confirmed by your bank, you can top up your IBHK account at any time by simply confirming the desired transfer amount in the **_Make a Deposit_** section of Client Portal.  Funds are generally received and credited within minutes.


**Deposit Methods Available to all Interactive Broker Clients**


**Local Bank Transfer**


Banks in HK offer interbank payments denominated in CNH via the renminbi RTGS system by opening renminbi settlement accounts with the Clearing Bank.  To make a local CNH transfer you will need to provide your HK bank, via online banking/branch, with the account details generated for you when you confirm your intended deposit details in the **_Make a Deposit_** section of Client Portal using the **_Bank Wire_** Deposit Method.  This includes the bank account name, bank code, branch code and bank account number.  Funds are generally received and credited within hours.


**International Bank Transfer \(SWIFT/ WIRE\)**


The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication \(SWIFT\), is a network that permits banks to communicate financial information securely around the globe.  Most banks offer international money transfers using the SWIFT network.  When a payment is instructed, a series of banks will work together to make sure your money arrives at the instructed destination account.


If you transfer CNH from a financial institution outside of Hong Kong, they may require the use of an intermediary or correspondent bank, to route the payment through, before reaching your account. These are known as cross-border payments. 


When making a bank transfer, they can take time to complete as processing involves several steps.  Especially for cross-border payments, as they are sent via the correspondent banking network and typically pass between several different banks along the way.  After being initiated, a wire transfer is sent by the debtor agent to an intermediary bank, before moving on to the creditor agent. Once these steps are complete, the recipient will receive their funds.


There are numerous reasons why a cross-border payment may be delayed or held up. Firstly, not all account balances can be updated outside of the operating hours of local settlement systems. Delays can also arise if compliance checks need to be carried out, especially when a payment passes through different countries and jurisdictions.  While clients are increasingly accustomed to a payments experience that feels instant, making a payment to another country can be much more complex and time-consuming.


To make an international CNH transfer you will need to provide your bank with the account details generated for you when you confirm your intended deposit details in the **_Make a Deposit_** section of Client Portal using the **_Bank Wire_** Deposit Method.  This includes the bank account name, bank code, branch code, bank account number, SWIFT code, account address and payment reference.


**Difference Between Domestic and International Bank Transfer**


Banks make a **domestic transfer** to send funds to financial institutions residing in the same country or financial zone. When sending funds to financial institutions in a foreign country or financial zone, banks have to make an **international bank transfer**. The differences between these two bank transfers affect the number of fees banks charge and the duration it takes to complete the transfer.

**BB**- 2 digits Bank routing code


**bbbb**- 4 digits branch code

https://www.ibkr.com/faq?id=428589176,Funding & Asset Transfers,Cash Deposits,Deposit Currencies,How do I deposit JPY to Interactive Brokers?,"Account holders depositing from a local Japanese bank should send funds via domestic fund transfer.


Please see below for more information regarding how to deposit funds into an IBSJ account.


**Instructions for how to deposit JPY into my IBSJ account**


A [deposit notification](https://www.interactivebrokers.ie/lib/cstools/faq/#/content/25487855) will be required. It is recommended that you always enter a deposit notification before arranging a fund transfer with your bank.


Account holders can notify MEXEM of an incoming fund transfer by entering a deposit notification in Client Portal via: Transfer & Pay > Transfer Funds > Make a Deposit.


Local bank transfers should use 'Domestic Bank Transfer.' Overseas accounts able to send JPY should use 'International Transfer.'


Banking instructions will be provided after submitting deposit information. It is recommended that you always confirm banking instructions registered with your bank match that provided when creating a deposit notification.


Contact your bank and confirm how to complete a fund transfer using the provided bank instructions.


IMPORTANT: A deposit notification instructs your intent to send funds to your IBSJ account. Notifications DO NOT move any funds. Please arrange with your bank to send funds to your IBSJ account.


**What methods can I use to fund my IBSJ account with JPY?**


**Local** - Clients sending funds from a local Japanese domestic bank should send funds via domestic fund transfer.


**International** - Deposits from overseas bank accounts must use the 'International Transfer' method to send JPY to their IBSJ account. Confirm procedures with your sending institution on how to send an international wire using the provided banking instructions.


For both methods, account holders should confirm fees and procedures with their bank before sending funds. IBSJ is not responsible for fees charged by your bank.


**What information does my bank need to transfer funds?**


**Local** - Local Japanese banks will need the IBSJ bank, bank code/branch code, bank account title & address, and 7-digit destination bank account number/VAN\*.


\*A VAN \(Virtual Account Number\) is a bank account number assigned specifically to you for domestic fund transfers.  It should be used exclusively for deposits initiated by yourself and should not be shared with anyone else. A VAN will not be used for international fund transfers


**International** - International transfers require IBSJ's bank information, SWIFT code, bank account title & address, and 10-digit bank account number. Be sure to include your name and U-account number in the memo/reference field of the transfer details. Failure to include this information may delay the arrival of funds to your account.


Contact Client Services should additional information or assistance be required.


**What information does** **MEXEM need to transfer funds?**


Please create a deposit notification as instructed above.


If funds are sent without a deposit notification, proof of deposit may be requested to credit the funds to your account.


**How long does it take for my funds to arrive into my IBSJ account?**


**Local** - You Japanese bank's daily cutoff times may affect the funds' arrival.


Should clients miss the daily deadline set by their bank, the funds should arrive the next business day. Please confirm this information with your Japanese bank.


**International** - The arrival of funds may take longer when sending JPY from an international bank via International Transfer \(up to 3-4 business days in some cases\).


Be sure to include your name and U-account number in the memo/reference field of the transfer details. Failure to include this information may delay the arrival of funds to your account.


Confirm that you have entered a matching deposit notification for your transfer. The arrival of funds may be delayed if funds are sent without a matching deposit notification.

| **Payment Type** |    | **Timing** |    | **Approximate Cost** |
| Domestic  |    | Same day/following business day |    | Free to a few hundred Yen |
| International \(SWIFT\) |    | 1 to 4 business days |    | Varies by bank |

As costs vary by institution, please consult with the sending institution about the costs incurred to process your payment. MEXEM does not charge fees for the deposit of funds


MEXEM credits funds to accounts in real time upon receipt. Please note that we do not have any control over the speed/processing of your fund transfer. You may consider consulting your bank regarding processing times.


Payments that are subject to review may take longer to credit to the account.


**Are third-party deposits into my IBSJ account permitted?**


Funds must be sent from a bank account held in your name. Funds sent from an account using a different name will be considered third-party and will be rejected.


**Does IBSJ charge for deposits?**


IBSJ does not charge a handling fee for deposits.


Related fees \(including, but not limited to: transfer fees, rejection fees, etc.\) are to be paid by the account holder. IBSJ is not responsible for fees incurred due to rejected deposits.


**Can I use a fund transfer service such as Wise or Revolut?**

Depending on which MEXEM entity your brokerage account is held with, you may be directed to deposit PLN into an MEXEM bank account held at a bank in Germany. However, please note that even though the bank account is located outside of Poland, it is denominated in PLN and can receive PLN transfers without issues.


Clients who receive our bank account details of our Polish bank, can perform regular local bank to bank transfers \(domestic payment\).


**IMPORTANT: You must instruct your bank to transfer PLN**


If your bank is located in Poland, your bank application may ask if you would prefer to send funds in the currency of the destination country \(which is EUR for Germany\). **Do not select to transfer EUR, and do not select SEPA as the transfer method as it is only valid for EUR transfers.**


Ensure that the currency sent by your bank is PLN. The Correspondent Bank information we provide are solely required if your bank explicitly asks you to confirm. Usually your bank will select the correspondent bank information on your behalf in the back ground and will not be asked to enter.


**What Information does my bank need to transfer PLN funds?**


MEXEM will provide you our IBAN \(International Bank Account Number\) and SWIFT code of our bank account which is valid for payments from outside and within Poland.


**Please Note**

* If you receive our bank routing information for our bank located in Germany, your bank may ask you in addition to the IBAN and SWIFT of our bank as well their Corespondent Bank information. You only need to provide them if your bank explicitly asks for them.
