      "Question ": "How do I deposit HKD to Interactive Brokers?",
      "Answer (TEXT)": "Different deposit methods may be available to you depending on the country in which your bank account is held and the MEXEM entity your trading account was opened under. \n\n\n**Deposit Methods Only Available to Clients of MEXEM Hong Kong Ltd \\(IBHK\\)**\n\n\n**Faster Payment System \\(FPS\\)**\n\n\nThe Faster Payment System is a payment infrastructure introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority \\(HKMA\\) and operated by Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited \\(HKICL\\) to enable instant payments in HK.\n\n\nFund transfers from your Hong Kong \\(HK\\) bank account are instructed by entering our FPS ID number, or by scanning a QR code, provided in our transfer instructions. While the FPS ID can be used for all transfer amounts, QR codes are only provided for small-value payments \\(i.e. 10,000 HKD or below\\).  Funds are generally received and credited within hours.\n\n\n**Electronic Direct Debit Authorization \\(****eDDA****\\)**\n\n\nUsing the Faster Payment System, eDDA offers a quick and convenient way to draw funds from your HK bank account to credit your IBHK account. \n\n\nTo setup your HK bank account for eDDA deposits, you simply need to select the transfer currency, provide your bank account number, and confirm your authorization for MEXEM to establish an eDDA on your behalf.  Once the initial eDDA setup request has been confirmed by your bank, you can top up your IBHK account at any time by simply confirming the desired transfer amount in the **_Make a Deposit_** section of Client Portal.  Funds are generally received and credited within minutes.\n\n\n**HKD Check**\n\n\nIBHK can accept personal checks either mailed or dropped off in person to one of our Hong Kong offices, so long as the check meets the following conditions:\n\n* It is denominated in Hong Kong Dollars,\n* It has a value of at least HKD 10,000.00,\n* It is not postdated or from a third-party bank account,\n* It is signed and dated by the account holder,\n* The back includes your IBHK account number \\(i.e. U\\#\\#\\#\\#\\#\\#\\#\\#\\) and account name\n\n\nIf the check is being dropped off, please ensure you have your HK ID / Passport with you.  If a third party is dropping off the check for you, they will need to have a letter, signed by you, authorizing them to do so on your behalf.\n\n\nFor mailed in checks, if you are sending the check to remove a funding restriction on your account, ensure the check is posted in the same letter as all supporting forms and a copy of your HK ID / Passport.\n\n\nChecks received by MEXEM before 12pm \\(non\\) are generally credited to your account within two business days. Funds will only be available in your account after the check is cleared by your bank. \n\n\n**Deposit Methods Available to all MEXEM Clients**\n\n\n**Domestic Bank Transfer**\n\n\nBanks in HK offer interbank payments in HKD. To make a local HKD transfer you will need to provide your HK bank, via online banking/branch, with the account details generated for you when you confirm your intended deposit details in the **_Make a Deposit_** section of Client Portal using the **_Bank Wire_** Deposit Method.  This includes the bank account name, bank code, branch code and bank account number. Depending on the times it takes for your bank to process the transfer funds are usually received and credited within hours.\n\n\n**International Bank Transfer \\(SWIFT/ WIRE\\)**\n\n\nThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication \\(SWIFT\\), is a network that permits banks to communicate financial information securely around the globe.  Most banks offer international money transfers using the SWIFT network.  When a payment is instructed, a series of banks will work together to make sure your money arrives at the instructed destination account.\n\n\nA transfer of HKD from a financial institution outside of Hong Kong is known as cross-border payment. Your bank may use an intermediary or correspondent bank to transfer the funds to our bank.\n\n\nCross-border payments can take some time to complete as they are processed via the correspondent banking network and typically pass between several different banks along the way.  After being initiated, a wire transfer is sent by the debtor agent to an intermediary bank, which transfers the funds to the creditor agent. Once these steps are complete, the recipient will receive their funds.\n\n\nThere are numerous reasons why a cross-border payment may be delayed or held up. Firstly, not all banks can process transfers outside of the operating hours of local settlement systems. Delays can also arise if compliance checks need to be carried out, especially when a payment passes through different countries and jurisdictions.  While newer payment systems allow almost instant transfers, making a payment to another country can be much more complex and time-consuming.\n\n\nTo make an international HKD transfer you will need to provide your bank with the account details generated for you when you confirm your intended deposit details in the **_Make a Deposit_** section of Client Portal using the **_Bank Wire_** Deposit Method.  This includes the bank account name, bank code, branch code, bank account number, SWIFT code, account address and payment reference.\n\n\n**Difference Between Domestic and International Bank Transfer**\n\n\nBanks make a **domestic transfer** to send funds to financial institutions residing in the same country or financial zone. When sending funds to financial institutions in a foreign country or financial zone, banks have to make an **international bank transfer**. The differences between these two bank transfers affect the number of fees banks charge and the duration it takes to complete the transfer.\n\n\n**Additional Information**\n\n* [How to Deposit HKD to MEXEM](https://MEXEM.info/article/4821)",

Depending on the times it takes for your bank to process the transfer funds are usually received and credited within hours.</p><p><strong>International Bank Transfer (SWIFT/ WIRE)</strong></p><p>The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), is a network that permits banks to communicate financial information securely around the globe.&nbsp; Most banks offer international money transfers using the SWIFT network.&nbsp; When a payment is instructed, a series of banks will work together to make sure your money arrives at the instructed destination account.</p><p>A transfer of HKD from a financial institution outside of Hong Kong is known as cross-border payment. Your bank may use an intermediary or correspondent bank to transfer the funds to our bank.</p><p>Cross-border payments can take some time to complete as they are processed via the correspondent banking network and typically pass between several different banks along the way.&nbsp; After being initiated, a wire transfer is sent by the debtor agent to an intermediary bank, which transfers the funds to the creditor agent. Once these steps are complete, the recipient will receive their funds.</p><p>There are numerous reasons why a cross-border payment may be delayed or held up. Firstly, not all banks can process transfers outside of the operating hours of local settlement systems. Delays can also arise if compliance checks need to be carried out, especially when a payment passes through different countries and jurisdictions.&nbsp; While newer payment systems allow almost instant transfers, making a payment to another country can be much more complex and time-consuming.</p><p>To make an international HKD transfer you will need to provide your bank with the account details generated for you when you confirm your intended deposit details in the <strong><em>Make a Deposit</em></strong> section of Client Portal using the <strong><em>Bank Wire</em></strong> Deposit Method.&nbsp; This includes the bank account name, bank code, branch code, bank account number, SWIFT code, account address and payment reference.</p><p><strong>Difference Between Domestic and International Bank Transfer</strong></p><p>Banks make a&nbsp;<strong>domestic transfer</strong>&nbsp;to send funds to financial institutions residing in the same country or financial zone. When sending funds to financial institutions in a foreign country or financial zone, banks have to make an&nbsp;<strong>international bank transfer</strong>. The differences between these two bank transfers affect the number of fees banks charge and the duration it takes to complete the transfer.</p><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://MEXEM.info/article/4821\">How to Deposit HKD to MEXEM</a></li></ul>",

      "Answer (TEXT)": "An ACH, while electronic, is similar to a check in that the funds are not guaranteed. As a result, they are subject to a hold period of 4 business days after arrival.

      "Question ": "What is a correspondent bank?",
      "Answer (TEXT)": "A correspondent bank is a bank that provides services on behalf of another financial institution. Correspondent banks are most likely to be used by domestic banks to service transactions that either originate or are completed in foreign countries, acting as a domestic bank's agent abroad.\n\n\nFor example: in case you transfer USD to a bank account in Singapore, the correspondent bank is the bank through which your bank in Singapore receives foreign currencies. Your bank in Singapore will have a correspondent bank in the US through which they receive USD. When you place a withdrawal request for USD, the funds will first be sent from our US bank account to the correspondent bank of your bank in the US and they will then send the funds to your bank in Singapore.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, the reasons domestic banks employ correspondent banks include the limited access to foreign financial markets and the inability to service client accounts without opening branches abroad.\n\n\nCorrespondent banking is an essential component of the global payment system, especially for cross-border transactions. Through correspondent banking relationships, banks can access financial services in different jurisdictions and provide cross-border payment services to their customers, supporting international trade and financial inclusion.\n\n\n**Additional Information**\n\n* [How can I find my correspondent bank?](https://www.interactivebrokers.ie/lib/cstools/faq/#/content/59325847)",

      "Question ": "What is the difference between Wire transfer and ACH transfer?",
      "Answer (TEXT)": "**Wire transfer:** An electronic movement of funds through the wire system. You must contact your bank to initiate a wire and must also include your MEXEM account name and number on the wire. Specific wire instructions and addresses will be displayed during the [deposit notification process](https://www.interactivebrokers.ie/lib/cstools/faq/#/content/27280950). Time to Arrive is from immediate to four business days, depending on your bank. Non-U.S. banks are generally at the longer end of the range. Credit to account is immediate upon arrival. MEXEM applies a one-day holding period to GBP Faster Payments. Wire transfer is available also for non-US bank accounts and for currencies other than USD. The Withdrawal Hold Period is three business days \\(you may withdraw funds after three business days\\). A wire cannot be internally transferred during the three-day hold period.\n\n\n**Please Note**\n\n* If funding an account with ILS, it is important that you request your bank to send the funds via the Zahav system. Funds received via the Masav \\(Bank of Israel's Automated Clearing House\\) system will not be accepted and will be returned.\n\n\n**US Automated Clearing House \\(ACH\\) Transfer Initiated at MEXEM:** A request for MEXEM to transfer funds through the ACH network. Initiation of an ACH transfer enables you to automatically deposit funds from a US bank to MEXEM. You will be required to enter your bank's ABA number and your bank account number. If you do not know your bank's ABA number, you can enter the bank name and city and search for the correct ABA number. You will be required to verify each new instruction.

      "Answer (HTML)": "<p><strong>Wire transfer:</strong>&nbsp;An electronic movement of funds through the wire system. You must contact your bank to initiate a wire and must also include your MEXEM account name and number on the wire. Specific wire instructions and addresses will be displayed during the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.interactivebrokers.com/lib/cstools/faq/#/content/27280950\">deposit notification process</a>. Time to Arrive is from immediate to four business days, depending on your bank. Non-U.S. banks are generally at the longer end of the range. Credit to account is immediate upon arrival. MEXEM applies a one-day holding period to GBP Faster Payments. Wire transfer is available also for non-US bank accounts and for currencies other than USD.

These are known as cross-border payments. \n\n\nWhen making a bank transfer, they can take time to complete as processing involves several steps.  Especially for cross-border payments, as they are sent via the correspondent banking network and typically pass between several different banks along the way.  After being initiated, a wire transfer is sent by the debtor agent to an intermediary bank, before moving on to the creditor agent.
